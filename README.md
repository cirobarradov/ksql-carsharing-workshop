This is designed to be run as a step-by-step demo. The `ksql-statements.sql` should match those run in this doc end-to-end and in theory you can just run the file, but I have not tested it. PRs welcome for a one-click script that just demonstrates the end-to-end running demo :)

The slides that accompany this demo can be found here: https://speakerdeck.com/rmoff/apache-kafka-and-ksql-in-action-lets-build-a-streaming-data-pipeline
